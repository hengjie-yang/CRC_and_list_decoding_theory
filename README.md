# CRC_and_list_decoding_theory
This repo contains scripts related to the theoretical analysis of DSO CRC search and list decoding.

*Written by Hengjie Yang (hengjie.yang@ucla.edu) 09/17/2020.*

## Purpose of this repository
This repo is associated with the ongoing TCOM manuscript "CRC-Aided List Decoding of Convolutional Codes in the Short Blocklength Regime".

### Planned scripts

1. Scripts that simulate the empirical distribution of the probability of the *j*-th order Voronoi regime of message *i*.
2. Scripts that plot the random coding union bound and the meta-converse bound.
